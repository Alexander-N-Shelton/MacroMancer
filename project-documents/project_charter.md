## I. General Information

**Project name:** MacroMancer  
**Project number:** 15984  
**Sponsor name:** Alexander Shelton  
**Date:** 12/17/2024  

## II. Project Overview  

This project aims to develop a **Python-based software solution** for Linux users to customize Razer peripherals. The software will enable:

- Key/button reassignment  
- Macro recording and assignment  
- Basic lighting configuration  

The project was initiated due to the **absence of Razer Synapse on Linux**, which limits Razer device functionality for Linux users.  

## III. Project Objectives  

- Develop a **CLI-based application** that integrates **OpenRazer**  
- Provide features for reassigning key/buttons and recording macros  
- Create a macro execution engine to bind actions to specific inputs  
- Ensure the software is **modular, scalable, and easy to maintain**  
- Complete **development and testing within 8 weeks**  

## IV. Requirements  

- Integrate **OpenRazer** for device communication  
- Support **key/button remapping and macro recording/assignment**  
- Provide **user configuration options** (e.g., JSON or YAML)  
- Test functionality on **supported Razer devices**  

## V. Business Justification  

The **absence of Razer Synapse on Linux** leaves users unable to fully utilize their Razer peripherals. This project **resolves that issue** by providing essential customization features.  

## VI. Resource Costs and Estimates  

- **Development Costs:** $0 (student-led project)  
- **Testing Hardware (Optional):** $200 for additional peripherals if needed  
- **Software Tools:** $0 (leveraging open-source libraries)  

## VII. Roles and Responsibilities  

- **Project Manager/Developer:** Alexander Shelton – Overall project development and delivery  
- **Sponsor:** Alexander Shelton – Approves and oversees project scope  
- **Stakeholders:** Linux users with Razer peripherals  

## VIII. Signatures  

**Project Sponsor:** Alexander N. Shelton  
**Project Manager:** Alexander N. Shelton  
**Key Stakeholders:** Linux Users
