## I. General Information

**Project name:**  Keyboard and Mouse Customization Software for Linux  
**Requestor name:** Alexander Shelton  
**Requestor’s contact information:** alexandershelton@student.purdueglobal.edu  
**Project number:** 15984

**Date of request:** 12/10/2024  

## II. Business Justification

Currently, Razer Synapse, the proprietary software for customizing Razer peripherals, is not available on Linux, leaving Linux users without a comprehensive way to customize their devices. This project addresses the gap by developing software that enables users to:

- Reassign keys  
- Record and assign macros  
- Configure device settings  

Without this solution, Linux users face limited functionality, reducing their productivity and customization options for Razer devices.  

## III. Project Description

The project aims to develop a **Python-based application for Linux systems** that integrates with the **OpenRazer library** to provide advanced customization options for Razer peripherals.  

### Features:
- **Key and Button Reassignment:** Allow users to remap keys or mouse buttons to perform new functions.  
- **Macro Recording and Assignment:** Enable users to record sequences of actions and assign them to specific keys or buttons.  
- **Lighting and Device Settings:** Provide basic lighting effects and configuration options.  

This software will include a **command-line interface (CLI)** for user interaction and will leverage OpenRazer for device communication.  

## IV. Project Costs  

**Estimated Costs:**  
- Testing hardware: **$0 - $500**  

## V. Timeframe  

**Critical Completion Date:** Yes  
- **Date required:** 02/01/2025  

## VI. Planning Estimates  

**High-level project completion estimate:** **≅ 8 weeks**  

## VII. Business Areas Impacted  

- **Linux-based device customization**  
- **Open-source software community**  
- **Razer peripheral users on Linux**
